## Phase 2: Traffic Light Detection and Processes data.
### creating data for the tarining. Built and trained CNN in order to determine a traffic light.

## Phase 3: Detect the distance to the traffic light. 
### Measured the geometric distance of each traffic light with SFM and Epipolar Geometry.

## Phase 4: Integration.
